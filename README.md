# MoodleCourse

This repository accompanies my learning journey in the Moodle Academy Development Environment course. The focus is on understanding how to set up, configure, and extend Moodle — the world’s most widely used open‑source learning management system.

Through this course, I explore:

🔧 Installing and configuring a local Moodle development environment

🧩 Creating and customizing plugins and themes

🗂️ Working with Moodle’s modular architecture and APIs

🛠️ Best practices for debugging, testing, and contributing to Moodle core

🌐 Building skills to support scalable and flexible e‑learning solutions

The goal is to gain hands‑on experience with Moodle’s development tools and workflows, preparing to contribute to real projects and enhance online learning platforms.
